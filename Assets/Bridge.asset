  gameText: 'The bridge used to split the town apart, physically and by social class.
    Now it is just physically after the casino was built. There are still visual
    differences between what is on each side. The left has more royal looking buildings,
    even the casino looks like it used to be a mansion and to the right it looks
    like the gardens own more land then the people with as many garden/ garden like
    areas as there are shops. '
